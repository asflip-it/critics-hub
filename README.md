# Critics Hub

For starter, this is me playing with some _webcrawling_ in video-game journalism sites for product reviews. The intent its to widen the scope and reaching a larger number of - or at least more than one - targets.

I'm well aware that some of them might have `API`'s for interaction, but still this project is for learning purposes and hobby =)
